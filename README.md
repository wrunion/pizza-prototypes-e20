# Winter's Rainbow Pizza Parlour

#### A colorful exercise in constructor functions, prototypes, and ES6 classes for Epicodus' JS/React Track. 2/17/2020

#### By **Winter A. Runion**

<!-- ### Description

#### Project Requirements (from [Epicodus' Epicenter](https://epicenter.epicodus.com/courses/526/code_reviews/2041)) -->
<!-- #### _**Pizza Parlor**_ -->

## Code Challenge:

_"Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost._

_"Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes."_
